# Art_social_determinism

Code for art social determinism project ongoing in MPIB CHM & UChicago KLab.

## Research Intuitives & Questions:


## What we have done:

### Prompt Making:

see folder [code/prompt_making](code/prompt_making)

Prompt for images: 5 random content prompt + _N_ random style prompt

    a. content prompt: generated by LlaVa v1.6 on images

    b. style prompt: generated by gpt-o3 on wikipedia texts

Prompts now follow naturalistic language rules.

Currently only involving name, year, style, gender, location, network

### Training by LoRA DreamBooth on SD3:

see folder [code/training_script](code/training_script)

### Validation Mission:

see folder [code/painting_test](code/painting_test)

randomly-selected 2000 paintings: test on different prompt conditions

### Flask Interface:

see folder [code/flask_interface](code/flask_interface)

## Next Steps:

### 1. Adding more information:

    a. more from existing information, such as age, education, nationality, religion, and parents info (need to extract again)

    b. more from external sources, such as wars, social movements, ... (need to search)

### 2. Another model?
