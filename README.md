## Research Intuition & Questions

**Is artistic form the result of personal agency or social constraint?**

- **Humanities Perspective â€” The Individualistic View of Culture**  
  Culture arises from exceptional creativity and personal expression.  
  *Key thinkers:* Kant (1790), Nietzsche (1872), Bloom (1973)

- **Social Sciences Perspective â€” The Collectivist View of Culture**  
  Culture is shaped by shared norms, institutions, and social structures.  
  *Key thinkers:* Bourdieu (1993), Becker (1982), Geertz (1973), Gorin et al. (2025)


## Current Research Pipeline

### 1. Prompt Construction  
*See:* [`code/prompt_making`](code/prompt_making)

Prompts are designed to simulate naturalistic image descriptions, combining both **content** and **style** elements:

- **Content prompts**:  
  Generated using *LLaVA v1.6* image captioning.
  
- **Style prompts**:  
  Synthesized from *Wikipedia texts* using *GPT-3.5-turbo (o3)*.

Each image receives 5 unique prompts, combining:
- A randomly sampled content caption
- _N_ randomly sampled style attributes from: `name`, `year`, `style`, `gender`, `location`, `network`

### 2. Model Training via LoRA DreamBooth on Stable Diffusion 3  
*See:* [`code/training_script`](code/training_script)

Fine-tuning conducted using [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) and [DreamBooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) on top of **Stable Diffusion 1.5**/**Stable Diffusion 3**, incorporating structured prompts.

### 3. Evaluation & Validation  
*See:* [`code/painting_test`](code/painting_test)

Evaluation conducted on a held-out sample of **2,000 paintings**, across varied prompt configurations to assess stylistic fidelity and representational realism.

Validation Results:

### 4. Interactive Web Interface  
*See:* [`code/flask_interface`](code/flask_interface)

Flask-based demo app for conditional image generation using trained models. Supports structured input via selectable attributes.

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

### 1. Enrich Metadata

- **From existing data**:
  - Add attributes such as `age`, `education`, `nationality`, `religion`, and `parentsâ€™ background` (requires re-extraction)

- **From external sources**:
  - Integrate contextual factors such as `wars`, `social movements`, or `political regimes` (requires historical research and knowledge graphs)

---

### 2. Model Extension to Stable Diffusion 1.5

- Conduct comparative experiments using SD 1.5 with the same prompt schema
- Analyze differences in semantic control, fidelity, and alignment

---

## ðŸ”® Future Directions

### 1. Tool Development

- **Public-facing**:  
  Educational and interactive tools for understanding the social construction of art

- **Expert-facing**:  
  Interfaces for researchers to refine prompts and test model sensitivity

---

### 2. Quantifying Social Determinism in Art

- Develop predictive models to assess how much of artistic form can be statistically explained by social variables
- Compare individual vs. structural contributions to aesthetic choices across time and geography

## Research Intuitives & Questions:

Is artistic form the result of personal agency or social constraint?

__Humanity - Individualistic view of culture:__

Culture arises from exceptional creativity and personal expression (Kant, 1790; Nietzsche, 1872; Bloom, 1973)

__Social Sciences - Collectivism view of culture:__

Culture is shaped by shared norms, institutions, and social structures (Bourdieu, 1993; Becker, 1982; Geertz, 1973; Gorin et al., 2025)

## Current Research Pipeline:

### Prompt Making:

see folder [code/prompt_making](code/prompt_making)

Prompt for images: 5 random content prompt + _N_ random style prompt

    a. content prompt: generated by LlaVa v1.6 on images

    b. style prompt: generated by gpt-o3 on wikipedia texts

Prompts now follow naturalistic language rules.

Currently only involving name, year, style, gender, location, network

### Training by LoRA DreamBooth on SD3:

see folder [code/training_script](code/training_script)

### Validation Mission:

see folder [code/painting_test](code/painting_test)

randomly-selected 2000 paintings: test on different prompt conditions

### Flask Interface:

see folder [code/flask_interface](code/flask_interface)

## Next Steps:

### 1. Adding more information:

a. more from existing information, such as age, education, nationality, religion, and parents info (need to extract again)

b. more from external sources, such as wars, social movements, ... (need to search)

### 2. SD 1.5


## Future Directions:

### 1. Tools:

*Public - hci, educational purpose

_Experts - refinement_

### 2. Predictability of social factors on arts
